##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
I actually learned the library the best through implementing my own examples. Looking at the code at first it can be a big jumble but after actually getting your own code working you start to understand how the API works a lot more clearly. One aspect of reply that made it easy to understand was that it was organized well and had good variable and function names so just reading the code alone felt like reading comments. The only thing that made it difficult to understand was that there were almost no comments and the readme is lacking the information about setting up your first program using the API. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
Raising the level of abstraction is Academia’s fun way of saying in layman’s term. A person who has no coding background should be able to look at your comment and know what that method will do. That user doesn’t need to know how it is working just that it works and what it does. If I had to explain this concept to a new student I would tell them not to think too hard about it, just think of a short and simple description of what the goal of the function is. 

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
About 6 hours because of weird formatting issues with JS Doc. 

##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
No classmates, just my best study buddy ever, google. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
The default template with JS Doc is convenient but can have strange formatting issues.
